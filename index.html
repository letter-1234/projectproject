This event takes place for 1 hour after school everyday, after which the students can go home. This church is very quiet and peaceful when the students come. If they wish, they can also stay in the church after other people go, and during emergencies, students can go home early as well. However, praying in the church everyday brings very good ethics and principles to our students. Not only this, but we also say an oath each day to make our students acheive their goals and targets, and let them keep following the rules always.</p>

                        <p class="text-mmuted"> This library was made for the good of our school's students. There is a one hour library period for each class where the students come, relax and read various kinds of books peacefully. There are a lot of books the students can read, they can also issue maximum of 2 books for 1 whole week to read. Once they return it, they get to issue other books. We have recently created a new space inside the library, and have ordered some shelves in it. We have been ordering books as well, so that our students get to read maximum and various kinds of books. But our library is not only used for reading, if the students want, they can come here anytime when they don't have any classes in school or anytime after school to study or complete their homeworks. This creates a peaceful environment for our students to complete their pending tasks.</p>

This audi is used of annual days, project exhibhitions and for assemblies as well. There are more than 100 seats for the parents to sit comfortably. The sound system is also extremeley good and even the people sitting at the back can hear whatever is said. The auditorium is also used for practice before any particular event. There is a backstage here as well, where the students can prepare for their turns. Not only this, but the backstage also includes refreshments for the students in case of long events so that they don't get tired or exhausted. And there are refreshmentws for the parents and teachers as well!! The school auditorium has been used for various events since the past 15 years.</p>

Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingridients help both the students and the parents to make the right decision of nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietry requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for the meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for the staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

      This system informs the parents about their child's activities dobne at school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of their students' absentiesm. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their cirriculams' subjects. As sson as you enter a student's enrollement number or name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended, etc. will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robustthat these students who always find their deans are caught in a shorter span - just after the admin enters the login details into this tracker. All this will improve the accuracy and transperency of any educational istitution, as students and their parents will be always preinformed about the realtime status of leave requests and absenteism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
